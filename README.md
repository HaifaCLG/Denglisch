German-English code-switching

We describe a corpus of German-English code-switching in social media interactions.
We focus on some challenges in annotating CS, especially due to words whose language ID cannot be easily determined. 
We introduce a novel schema for such word-level annotation, with which we manually annotated a subset of the corpus.
We then trained classifiers to predict and identify switches, and applied them to the remainder of the corpus. 
Thereby, we created a large-scale corpus of German-English mixed utterances with precise indications of CS points.
